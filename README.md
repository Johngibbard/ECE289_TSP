How to run EXEs, run the respective euclidian or random executable
run the exes from the command line (if you open them by clicking on them the window will close before you see the result)
here is the command to run each


.\HW3_ACO_euclid.exe

.\HW3_ACO_random.exe

If you get an errors that shows that you don't have: libgomp-1.dll

run the versions that say no_gomp

.\HW3_ACO_euclid_no_gomp.exe

.\HW3_ACO_random_no_gomp.exe
